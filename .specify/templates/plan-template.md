# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: PHP 8.2+
**Primary Dependencies**: Laravel, Vue.js
**Storage**: MariaDB (via Docker)
**Testing**: PHPUnit
**Target Platform**: Web (Docker)
**Project Type**: Web Application
**Performance Goals**: TBD
**Constraints**: Must run within the existing Docker setup.
**Scale/Scope**: TBD

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **[ ] Principle I (Modular Design):** Is the feature designed as a self-contained module?
- **[ ] Principle II (API-First):** Is the feature exposed via a documented API?
- **[ ] Principle III (TDD):** Are tests written before implementation?
- **[ ] Principle IV (Comprehensive Testing):** Are integration tests included?
- **[ ] Principle V (Versioning):** Is the change versioned correctly?

**Structure Decision**: The project follows the standard Laravel project structure. New features should extend this structure by adding relevant files to the appropriate directories.


## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
