# User Guide: Creating Your Account

## What is it for?

This feature allows you to create an account and log in to the "Cards" application in a single click using your existing Google account. It's fast, secure, and means you don't have to remember another password!

## How to Use It

1.  **Click the Login Button:** On the application's home page, click the "Sign in with Google" button.

4.  **You're In!** You will be automatically redirected back to the application and logged in. Your account is now created, and you can start studying.
